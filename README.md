Here's a comprehensive README.md report for your Hangman game project following the requested structure:

# Hangman Game - Python OOP Implementation

## Introduction
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with Pygame for graphical interface. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word or riddle answer with visual feedback and sound effects.

### Purpose and Objectives
- Demonstrate advanced OOP concepts in Python
- Implement clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Showcase design pattern usage in game development
- Provide an interactive graphical game experience
- Include sound effects and visual feedback

## Problem Definition and Requirements

### Problem Statement
Traditional Hangman implementations often lack:
- Modular architecture
- Extensible design
- Visual feedback
- Sound effects
- Proper game state management

This implementation solves these issues with:
- Clear separation of game logic and presentation
- Multiple game modes (words and riddles)
- Difficulty levels
- Sound and visual feedback
- Game state persistence

### Functional Requirements Implemented

#### 1. OOP Pillars
- **Encapsulation**:
  ```python
  class HangmanGame:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__secret_word = ""  # Private attribute
          self.__guessed_letters = set()
  ```
  
- **Inheritance**:
  ```python
  class WordSource(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def get_word(self):
          pass
  ```

- **Polymorphism**:
  ```python
  class Display(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def show_game_state(self, game):
          pass
  ```

- **Abstraction**:
  ```python
  class GameSaver(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def save_game(self, game_state):
          pass
  ```

#### 2. Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern** (Logger class):
  ```python
  class Logger:
      _instance = None
      def __new__(cls):
          if cls._instance is None:
              cls._instance = super(Logger, cls).__new__(cls)
  ```

- **Strategy Pattern** (Word selection):
  ```python
  class WordStrategy(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      def select_word(self, word_data):
          pass
  ```

#### 3. File I/O Operations
- Reading words from JSON files:
  ```python
  def load_words(self):
      with open("words.json") as f:
          words_data = json.load(f)
  ```
- Logging game events to file

#### 4. Testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation
- Game state validation

#### 5. Additional Features
- Sound effects system
- Animated win/lose states
- Difficulty levels
- Hint system
- Visual feedback

## Design and Implementation

### Class Structure
```
Core Classes:
- HangmanApp (Main application)
- HangmanGame (Game logic)
- Button (UI Component)
- Logger (Singleton)
- WordStrategy (Strategy pattern)

Supporting Classes:
- AnimatedGIF (Visual effects)
- GameEntity (Base class)
```

### Key Components
1. **Game Logic**:
   - Word selection and masking
   - Guess validation
   - Win/lose conditions

2. **UI System**:
   - Menu navigation
   - Button interactions
   - Visual feedback

3. **Audio System**:
   - Background music

   - Volume control

4. **Persistence**:
   - Game logging
   - Word/riddle storage

### Data Structures
- Dictionaries for word/riddle storage
- Lists for animation frames
- Sets for tracking guessed letters

## Development Process

### Tools and Environment
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- JSON for data storage
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Git for version control

### Implementation Steps
1. Core game logic implementation
